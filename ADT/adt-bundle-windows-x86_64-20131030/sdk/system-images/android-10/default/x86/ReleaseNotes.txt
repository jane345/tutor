Hardware Feature Emulation
Please note that certain hardware features (such as camera, accelerometer, etc.) are unavailable on emulated devices.


Modulo Floating Point Precision
Due to software emulation, floating point modulo operations may differ in precision from actual x86 hardware. For modulo operations requiring high precision, it is advised to develop on Linux with KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) enabled, or to verify floating point calculations on Intel hardware. 

For example, the result of "3.40282346638528860e+38f % - 1E-9f" will differ slightly depending on whether or not KVM is used:

Expected result of Emulator x86 without KVM	
6.35826946648876000000e-10

Expected result of Emulator x86 with KVM
7.25848936511397000000e-10
